Our goal was to create an application that will modernize MSOE's Tech Support inventory management system by streamlining the process to check in and out items and providing a way to monitor inventory.
Key features of Consus include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Barcode and RFID scanners to scan both student IDs and equipment barcodes
  \item Notifications for students to return equipment
  \item Tracking all pieces of Tech Support equipment and maintaining information such as manufacturer and a fault history
  \item Maintaining a list of all equipment checked out by each student
  \item Tracking all overdue equipment and prevent students with overdue equipment from checking out new items
\end{itemize}

\section{The Four Fifths}

The Four Fifths is the Software Engineering Senior Design Team that created Consus.
The team members are: Quentin Caffero, Tony Fay, Trevin Hofmann, Jordan Longato, and Matthew Mahnke.
We were advised by Adjunct Assistant Professor Jon Hopkins during the 2016--17 academic school year.
